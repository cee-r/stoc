# Sticky Table of Contents for Champion.gg

A script to add a sticky table of contents for champion.gg and organize champion info to improve usability and readability.

## Overview

As a casual player who needs access to quick info about champs, I find champion.gg's current layout and organization of information to be a bit overwhelming. The in-depth information they provide is very useful but takes a bit to sift through, especially in the time constraints of champ select.

This script aims to reorganize the info as well as provide skip to content for easy access.
