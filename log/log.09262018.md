Initial idea brainstorm

### Pain Points

* Users are presented by overwhelming amount of info which wouldn't be necessarily needed at that particular moment at once. IE, some might simply need a quick build or runes look up.
* Sorted in an unintuitive way and isn't as easy/quick to find.

### Solutions

* Review information hierarchy to see how content can be sorted
    - Organize by need or stages of a player going into a match:
        - DRAFT. Player might need information on champ match ups (Counters, etc).
        - LOAD OUT. Player would need info on stuff to be set before the match loads (Runes, Summoners)
        - IN GAME. Player would need info on stuff to get in game (Skill order, Items, etc.)
        - [Info Hierarchy]((notes/ux-info-heirarchy.md)
* Add a skip to content functionality that is always available regardless of where you are on the page
    - Anchor links to header
    - Sticky menu of some sort
* Contain information with a clean and compact layout

### Misc thoughts

* Possibly a slide out side panel with toggle
* Would need to find all headings and add ids for anchor
