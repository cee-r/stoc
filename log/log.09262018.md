Initial idea brainstorm

### Pain Points

* Users are presented by overwhelming amount of info which wouldn't be necessarily needed at that particular moment at once. IE, some might simply need a quick build or runes look up.
* Sorted in an unintuitive way and isn't as easy/quick to find.

### Solutions

* Review information hierarchy to see how content can be sorted
··* Organize by need or stages of a player going into a match:
··· DRAFT. Player might need information on champ match ups.\
