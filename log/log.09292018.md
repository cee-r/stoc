### Updates

- [x] Added conditional for additional match ups with botlane champs
- [x] Organize and style ToC links
- [x] Added sticky area with search and league drop down, tweaked css
- [x] Tweak top bar, header, sticky'd and media width
- [x] Added offset for sticky header
- [x] Champ area revamp

### Thoughts

* Margin collapse issue with h3 and ul
* Issue sticky nav blocks anchors
    - Minimize sticky
    - :target not working
    - :before spacing, anchor / label
    - Margin not working on initial scroll when fixed header isn't visible
* Frequent and Win % order consistency
* Revamp General stats, ToC and area
* Fix most frequent rune weirdness...
* Remove border
