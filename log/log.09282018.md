- [x] Added smooth scrolling animation


### To Do

- [ ] Organize and style ToC links
- [ ] Organize content
- [ ] Fix and add styling tweaks
- [ ] Add UX improvement to important sections, interactive elements
- [ ] Style details

### Thoughts

* ToC too long and I don't want the overflow to scroll
    - Remove search/btp and add somewhere else.
    - Combine Starters and Trinkets
    - Collapse Analytics
    - Move misc into Analytics
* Need controls to always be accessible
    - Search, League, Role, Back to top
    - Sticky header on scroll?
* Analytics taking too much real estate
    - Collapse?
* Organize
    - Move probuilds link to builds
    - Move frequent runes
* Issue: How to handle additional match ups (Bot Lane Champs)
    - If topic 22 = reddit thread, dont display additional match ups ?
    - ADC/SUPP Matchup, ADC/SUPP Synergy
